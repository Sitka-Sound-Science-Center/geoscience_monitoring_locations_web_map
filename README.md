### About
This is a map of the environmental monitoring locations in Southeast Alaska. This map was created as a deliverable for a USGS Landslide Monitoring and Risk Reduction Grant.

This map aims to shed light on the different types of monitoring stations in the region, the usage of the monitoring stations, and other descriptive information about the locations. We hope this map allows you to make connections, draw conclusions, and explore Southeast Alaska in new ways!
